## Overview
Proposes quantum computations in microtubules with objective state reductions as the basis of conscious moments.

## Core claims / mechanism
- Microtubule quantum computation; objective reduction events correspond to conscious moments.

## Evidence and critiques
- Evidence: proposed microtubule computations; controversial.
- Critiques: decoherence timescales; biological plausibility.

## Relations
- Part of quantum approaches to consciousness.

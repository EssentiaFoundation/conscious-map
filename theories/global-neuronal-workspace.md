## Overview
Neural implementation focusing on long-range workspace neurons that support ignition/broadcast.

## Core claims / mechanism
- Workspace neurons with long-range connectivity enable ignition and sustaining of conscious contents.

## Evidence and critiques
- Evidence: P3, ignition patterns, connectivity analyses.
- Critiques: phenomenal vs access distinctions; local recurrence advocates.

## Relations
- Neural implementation/near-equivalent of GWT.

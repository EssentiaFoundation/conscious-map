## Overview
Proposes awareness as a model of attention processes.

## Core claims / mechanism
- Internal “schema” describes and predicts attention; awareness reports derive from it.

## Evidence and critiques
- Evidence: attentional control phenomena; computational models.
- Critiques: relationship to phenomenality.

## Relations
- Related to attention-based accounts and self-model theory.

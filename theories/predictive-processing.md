## Overview
Predictive processing frames the brain as an inference machine minimizing prediction error.

## Core claims / mechanism
- Hierarchical generative models; precision-weighting; active inference.

## Evidence and critiques
- Evidence: broad explanatory reach across perception and action.
- Critiques: relation to phenomenality vs computation; testability of precision mechanisms.

## Relations
- Potential hybridization with global broadcast; metacognitive accounts link confidence and awareness.

## Overview
IIT links consciousness to intrinsic causal power (Φ) and the structure of a system’s causal repertoire.

## Core claims / mechanism
- Φ measures integrated information; maximal complexes correspond to experiences.

## Evidence and critiques
- Evidence: perturbational complexity index; theoretical development.
- Critiques: exclusion/realization issues; applicability to biological vs artificial systems.

## Relations
- Potential complementarity with global access accounts.

## Overview
Local recurrent processing in sensory areas may suffice for phenomenality.

## Core claims / mechanism
- Feedback loops within modality-specific cortex generate phenomenal contents.

## Evidence and critiques
- Evidence: masking, timing studies, local recurrence signatures.
- Critiques: access/report dissociations and global signatures.

## Relations
- In tension with global broadcast accounts.

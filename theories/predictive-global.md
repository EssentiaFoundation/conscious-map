## Overview
Hybrid linking predictive precision-weighting with global broadcast dynamics.

## Core claims / mechanism
- Precision-weighted routing yields ignition-like global availability.

## Evidence and critiques
- Speculative synthesis; requires empirical validation of precision-driven broadcast.

## Relations
- Bridges predictive processing and GWT/GNW.

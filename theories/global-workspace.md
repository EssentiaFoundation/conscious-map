## Overview
Consciousness arises when information becomes globally available for broadcast to multiple cognitive systems.

## Core claims / mechanism
- Global broadcast/ignition enables access by attention, memory, decision systems.

## Evidence and critiques
- Evidence: P3/ignition, long-range connectivity.
- Critiques: local recurrent accounts argue broadcast not necessary for phenomenality.

## Relations
- Equivalent/implementation: Global Neuronal Workspace.
- Opposition: Recurrent Processing Theory.
- Compatibility: Some views relate IIT structure to global access.
